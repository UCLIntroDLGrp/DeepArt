## Pretrained Weights for transfer learning
This Directory contains the pre-trained weights for known models. Before running the code, 
these weights need to be downloaded from the internet. Links provided below:


For VGG16 : Download vgg16_weights_th_dim_ordering_th_kernels.h5  and vgg16_weights_tf_dim_ordering_tf_kernels.h5
from [here](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-models/releases).
